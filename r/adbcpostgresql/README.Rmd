# adbcpostgresql

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of adbcpostgresql is to provide a low-level developer-facing interface
to the Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC) PostgreSQL driver.

## Installation

You can install the development version of adbcpostgresql from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("apache/arrow-adbc/r/adbcpostgresql")
```

ADBC drivers for R use a relatively new feature of pkgbuild to enable installation from GitHub via pak. Depending on when you installed pak, you may need to update its internal version of pkgbuild.

``` r
install.packages("pkgbuild", pak:::private_lib_dir())
pak::cache_clean()
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(adbcdrivermanager)

# Use the driver manager to connect to a database
uri <- Sys.getenv("ADBC_POSTGRESQL_TEST_URI")
db <- adbc_database_init(adbcpostgresql::adbcpostgresql(), uri = uri)
con <- adbc_connection_init(db)

# Write a table
flights <- head(nycflights13::flights, 100)
# (timestamp not supported yet)
flights$time_hour <- NULL
flights |>
  write_adbc(con, "flights")

# Query it
con |>
  read_adbc("SELECT * from flights") |>
  tibble::as_tibble()
```

```{r example-clean-up}
# Clean up
con |>
  execute_adbc("DROP TABLE flights")
adbc_connection_release(con)
adbc_database_release(db)
```
