# adbcsnowflake

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of adbcsnowflake is to provide a low-level developer-facing interface
to the Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC) Snowflake driver.

## Installation

You can install the development version of adbcsnowflake from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("apache/arrow-adbc/r/adbcdrivermanager", build = FALSE)
remotes::install_github("apache/arrow-adbc/r/adbcsnowflake", build = FALSE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. For examples
of `uri` values to use as a connection value, see the documentation for the
[upstream Go driver implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/blob/main/docs/source/driver/go/snowflake.rst#uri-format).


```{r example}
library(adbcdrivermanager)

# Use the driver manager to connect to a database. This example URI is
# <user>:<pass>@wt78143.<aws region>.aws/SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA/TPCH_SF1?role=ACCOUNTADMIN
uri <- Sys.getenv("ADBC_SNOWFLAKE_TEST_URI")
db <- adbc_database_init(adbcsnowflake::adbcsnowflake(), uri = uri)
con <- adbc_connection_init(db)

stmt <- adbcdrivermanager::adbc_statement_init(con)
adbcdrivermanager::adbc_statement_set_sql_query(
  stmt,
  "SELECT * FROM REGION ORDER BY R_REGIONKEY"
)

stream <- nanoarrow::nanoarrow_allocate_array_stream()
adbcdrivermanager::adbc_statement_execute_query(stmt, stream)
tibble::as_tibble(stream)
```

```{r example-clean-up2}
# Clean up
adbc_connection_release(con)
adbc_database_release(db)
```
