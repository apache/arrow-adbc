# adbcsnowflake

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of adbcsnowflake is to provide a low-level developer-facing interface
to the Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC) Snowflake driver.

## Installation

You can install the development version of adbcsnowflake from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("apache/arrow-adbc/r/adbcsnowflake")
```

ADBC drivers for R use a relatively new feature of pkgbuild to enable installation from GitHub via pak. Depending on when you installed pak, you may need to update its internal version of pkgbuild.

``` r
install.packages("pkgbuild", pak:::private_lib_dir())
pak::cache_clean()
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. For examples
of `uri` values to use as a connection value, see the
[Snowflake driver documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/driver/snowflake.html#uri-format). Single sign-on browser-based authentication is also supported.

```{r example}
library(adbcdrivermanager)

# Use the driver manager to connect to a database. This example URI is
# <user>:<pass>@wt78143.<aws region>.aws/SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA/TPCH_SF1?role=ACCOUNTADMIN
uri <- Sys.getenv("ADBC_SNOWFLAKE_TEST_URI")
db <- adbc_database_init(adbcsnowflake::adbcsnowflake(), uri = uri)
con <- adbc_connection_init(db)

con |>
  read_adbc("SELECT * FROM REGION ORDER BY R_REGIONKEY") |>
  tibble::as_tibble()
```

```{r example-clean-up2}
# Clean up
adbc_connection_release(con)
adbc_database_release(db)
```
