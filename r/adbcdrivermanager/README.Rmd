# adbcdrivermanager

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of adbcdrivermanager is to provide a low-level developer-facing interface
to Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC) for the purposes of driver development, testing,
and support for user-facing packages that rely on ADBC drivers.

## Installation

You can install the released version of adbcdrivermanager from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```r
install.packages("adbcdrivermanager")
```

You can install the development version of adbcdrivermanager from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("apache/arrow-adbc/r/adbcdrivermanager", build = FALSE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(adbcdrivermanager)

# Get a reference to a database using a driver. The adbcdrivermanager package
# contains a few drivers useful for illustration and testing.
db <- adbc_database_init(adbc_driver_monkey())

# Open a new connection to a database
con <- adbc_connection_init(db)

# Initialize a new statement from a connection
stmt <- adbc_statement_init(con)

# The monkey driver allows you to specify the data for a query
# in advance for testing purposes
adbc_statement_bind_stream(stmt, nycflights13::flights)

# Set the query
adbc_statement_set_sql_query(stmt, "SELECT * FROM flights")

# Start executing the query. Results in ADBC are ArrowArrayStream objects,
# which can be materialized using as.data.frame(), as_tibble(),
# or converted to an arrow::RecordBatchReader using
# arrow::as_record_batch_reader()
stream <- nanoarrow::nanoarrow_allocate_array_stream()
adbc_statement_execute_query(stmt, stream)

# Materialize the whole query as a tibble
tibble::as_tibble(stream)

# Clean up!
adbc_statement_release(stmt)
adbc_connection_release(con)
adbc_database_release(db)
```
