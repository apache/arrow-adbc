# Flight SQL
The Flight SQL tests leverage the interop nature of the C# ADBC library. These require the use of the [Flight SQL Go driver](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/tree/main/go/adbc/driver/flightsql). You will need to compile the Go driver for your platform and place the driver in the correct path in order for the tests to execute correctly.

To compile, navigate to the `go/adbc/pkg` directory of the cloned [arrow-adbc](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc) repository then run the `make` command.  If you encounter compilation errors, please ensure that Go, [GCC and C++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) tools are installed. And following [Contributing to ADBC](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#environment-setup).

## Setup
The environment variable `FLIGHTSQL_INTEROP_TEST_CONFIG_FILE` must be set to a configuration JSON file for the tests to execute. If it is not, the tests will show as passed with an output message that they are skipped. A template configuration file can be found in the Resources directory.

## Configuration
A growing number of data sources support Arrow Flight SQL. This library has tests that run against:

- [Denodo](https://community.denodo.com/docs/html/browse/9.1/en/vdp/developer/access_through_flight_sql/connection_using_flight_sql/connection_using_flight_sql)
- [Dremio](https://docs.dremio.com/current/sonar/developing-client-apps/arrow-flight-sql/)
- [DuckDB](https://github.com/voltrondata/SQLFlite)
- [SQLite](https://github.com/voltrondata/SQLFlite)
- [Spice.ai OSS](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai)

It is recommended you test your data source with the Flight SQL Go driver to ensure compatibility, since each data source can implement the Flight protocol slightly differently.

A sample configuration file is provided in the Resources directory. The configuration file is a JSON file that contains the following fields:

- **uri**: The endpoint for the service
- **username**: User name to use for authentication
- **password**: Password to use for authentication
- **sslSkipVerify**: "adbc.flight.sql.client_option.authority",
- **headers**: Key/value pairs of additional headers to include with the request.
- **supportsWriteUpdate**: Indicates whether the data source supports creating new tables
- **supportsCatalogs**: Indicates whether the data source supports catalog names
- **type**: Specifies the type of data source used for running data from FlightSqlData. The supported types are:
    - Dremio
    - Denodo
    - DuckDB
    - SQLite
    - SpiceAI
- **tableTypes**: The table types to include in the GetObjects call
- **sqlFile**: A path to a SQL file to run queries to test CRUD operations
- **metadata**: Used for the GetObjects calls
  - **catalog**: The catalog name to use for the GetObjects call
  - **schema**: The schema name to use for the GetObjects call
  - **table**: The table name to use for the GetObjects call
  - **expectedColumnCount**: The number of columns that should be returned
- **authorization**: Used to set the `adbc.flight.sql.authorization_header` property
- **authority**: Used to set the `adbc.flight.sql.client_option.authority` property
- **query**: Select query run against the data source,
- **expectedResults**: Number of results expected from the query

The configuration file supports targeting multiple data sources
simultaneously. To use multiple data sources, you can configure them like:

```
    "testEnvironments**: [
        "Dremio_Remote",
        "DuckDb_Local",
        "SQLite_Local"
    ],
    "environments**: {
        "SQLite_Local**:
        {
           ...
        },
        "DuckDb_Local**:
        {
           ...
		},
        "Dremio_Remote**: {
           ...
        }
```

### Spice.ai OSS Configuration

Use the following command to run a local test instance of Spice.ai OSS. An example test configuration is available at [flightsql-spiceai.json](/ci/configs/flightsql-spiceai.json).

```bash
docker-compose up spiceai-test
```

Output:
