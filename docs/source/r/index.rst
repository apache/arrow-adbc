ADBC in R is implemented as a suite of R packages. Most users will
interact with ADBC via the `adbcdrivermanager <adbcdrivermanager/index.html>`_
package and use drivers that are also distributed as R packages. In
addition to the low-level interface provided by adbcdrivermanager,
you can use ``read_adbc()``, ``write_adbc()`` and ``execute_adbc()``
to quickly interact with an ADBC connection or database.

.. code-block:: r

   library(adbcdrivermanager)

   # Use the driver manager to connect to a database
   db <- adbc_database_init(adbcsqlite::adbcsqlite(), uri = ":memory:")
   con <- adbc_connection_init(db)

   # Write a table
   mtcars |>
     write_adbc(con, "mtcars")

   # Query it
   con |>
     read_adbc("SELECT * from mtcars") |>
     tibble::as_tibble()

   # Clean up
   con |>
     execute_adbc("DROP TABLE mtcars")
   adbc_connection_release(con)
   adbc_database_release(db)

See individual package documentation for installation and usage
details specific to each driver.
