// RECIPE STARTS HERE

/// After we've written a sketch of the driver, the next step is to
/// ensure that it can be loaded by the driver manager and that the
/// database, connection, and statement instances can be initialized and
/// released.
///
/// First, we'll include the driver manager and googletest_.
///
/// .. _googletest: https://github.com/google/googletest

#include "driver_example.h"

#include "arrow-adbc/adbc_driver_manager.h"
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

// Next we'll declare a test case for the basic lifecycle:

TEST(DriverExample, TestLifecycle) {
  struct AdbcError error = ADBC_ERROR_INIT;

  struct AdbcDatabase database;
  ASSERT_EQ(AdbcDatabaseNew(&database, &error), ADBC_STATUS_OK);
  AdbcDriverManagerDatabaseSetInitFunc(&database, &AdbcDriverExampleInit, &error);
  ASSERT_EQ(AdbcDatabaseSetOption(&database, "uri", "file://foofy", &error),
            ADBC_STATUS_OK);
  ASSERT_EQ(AdbcDatabaseInit(&database, &error), ADBC_STATUS_OK);

  struct AdbcConnection connection;
  ASSERT_EQ(AdbcConnectionNew(&connection, &error), ADBC_STATUS_OK);
  ASSERT_EQ(AdbcConnectionInit(&connection, &database, &error), ADBC_STATUS_OK);

  struct AdbcStatement statement;
  ASSERT_EQ(AdbcStatementNew(&connection, &statement, &error), ADBC_STATUS_OK);

  ASSERT_EQ(AdbcStatementRelease(&statement, &error), ADBC_STATUS_OK);
  ASSERT_EQ(AdbcConnectionRelease(&connection, &error), ADBC_STATUS_OK);
  ASSERT_EQ(AdbcDatabaseRelease(&database, &error), ADBC_STATUS_OK);

  if (error.release) {
    error.release(&error);
  }
}

/// Drivers that live in the apache/arrow-adbc repository can use the built-in
/// validation library that implements a generic test suite against a fully-featured
/// SQL database and provides utilities to test a range of inputs and outputs.
