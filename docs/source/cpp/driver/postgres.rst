==================
libpq-based Driver
==================

The Flight SQL Driver provides access to any database that supports
the Postgres wire format.

Installation
============

The libpq-based driver is shipped as a standalone library.  See
:ref:`Installation <cpp-install-libpq>`.

Usage
=====

To connect to a database, supply the "uri" parameter when constructing
the :cpp:class:`AdbcDatabase`.  This should be a `connection URI
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING>`_.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: cpp

      .. code-block:: cpp

         #include "adbc.h"

         // Ignoring error handling
         struct AdbcDatabase database;
         AdbcDatabaseNew(&database, nullptr);
         AdbcDatabaseSetOption(&database, "uri", "postgresql://localhost:5433", nullptr);
         AdbcDatabaseInit(&database, nullptr);

   .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: python

      .. code-block:: python

         import adbc_driver_postgres.dbapi


         uri = "postgresql://localhost:5433"
         with adbc_driver_postgres.dbapi.connect(uri) as conn:
             pass
