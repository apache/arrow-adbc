// RECIPE STARTS HERE

/// Here we'll briefly tour basic features of ADBC with the SQLite
/// driver in C++17.

/// Installation
/// ============
///
/// This quickstart is actually a literate C++ file.  You can clone
/// the repository, build the sample, and follow along.
///
/// We'll assume you're using conda-forge_ for dependencies.  CMake, a
/// C++17 compiler, and the ADBC libraries are required.  They can be
/// installed as follows:
///
/// .. code-block:: shell
///
///    mamba install cmake compilers libadbc-driver-manager libadbc-driver-sqlite
///
/// .. _conda-forge: https://conda-forge.org/

/// Building
/// ========
///
/// We'll use CMake_ here.  From a source checkout of the ADBC repository:
///
/// .. code-block:: shell
///
///    cd docs/source/cpp/recipe
///    cmake .
///    cmake --build . --target quickstart
///    ./quickstart
///
/// .. _CMake: https://cmake.org/

/// Using ADBC
/// ==========
///
/// Let's start with some includes:

// For EXIT_SUCCESS
#include <cstdlib>
// For strerror
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

#include <adbc.h>
#include <nanoarrow.h>

/// Then we'll add some (very basic) error checking helpers.

// Error-checking helper for ADBC calls.
// Assumes that there is an AdbcError named `error` in scope.

    return EXIT_FAILURE;                                          \
  }
