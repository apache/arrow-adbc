   Arrow Flight SQL
     A :term:`wire protocol` for data systems that uses Apache Arrow.
     See the :external:doc:`specification <format/FlightSql>`.

   client API
     The API that an application uses to interact with a database.  May
     abstract over the underlying :term:`wire protocol` and other details.
     For example, ADBC, JDBC, ODBC.

   connection
     In ADBC, the connection object/struct represents a single connection to a
     database.  Multiple connections may be created from one :term:`database`.

   database
     In ADBC, the database object/struct holds state that is shared across
     connections.

   driver
     Loosely speaking, a library that implements a :term:`client API` using a
     :term:`wire protocol`.  For example, the ADBC PostgreSQL driver exposes
     the ADBC client API and interacts with a PostgreSQL database via the
     PostgreSQL wire protocol.  The JDBC PostgreSQL driver uses the same wire
     protocol, but exposes the JDBC client API instead.

   driver manager
     A library that helps manage multiple drivers for a given client API.
     For example, the JDBC driver manager can find a appropriate driver
     implementation for a database URI.

     The ADBC driver manager in each language is similar.  In C/C++, it can
     dynamically load drivers so that applications do not have to directly
     link to them.  (Since all drivers expose the same API, their symbols
     would collide otherwise.)  In Python, it loads drivers and provides
     Python bindings on top.

   statement
     In ADBC, the statement object/struct holds state for executing a single
     query.  The query itself, bind parameters, result sets, and so on are all
     tied to the statement.  Multiple statements may be created from one
     :term:`connection` (though not all drivers will support this).

   Substrait
     `Substrait`_ describes itself as a "cross-language serialization for
     relational algebra".  It operates in a similar space as SQL, but is
     lower-level.  You're unlikely to write a Substrait query by hand, but may
     use tools that opt to generate Substrait instead of SQL for more
     predictable semantics.

   wire protocol
     The actual way a database driver connects to a database, issues commands,
     gets results, and so forth.  For example, :term:`Arrow Flight SQL`, the
     `PostgreSQL wire protocol`_, or `Tabular Data Stream`_ (Microsoft SQL
     Server).  Generally, an application is not going to implement and use this
     directly, but instead use something higher-level, like an ADBC, JDBC, or
     ODBC driver.
