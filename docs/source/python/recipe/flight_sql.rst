==================
Flight SQL Recipes
==================

Some of these recipes are written againt a demo Flight SQL service backed by
SQLite.  You can run it yourself as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ go install github.com/apache/arrow/go/v${ARROW_MAJOR_VERSION}/arrow/flight/flightsql/example/cmd/sqlite_flightsql_server@latest
   $ sqlite_flightsql_server -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080

Other recipes work using the OSS version of Dremio_:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker run -p 9047:9047 -p 31010:31010 -p 45678:45678 dremio/dremio-oss

If you have the ADBC repository checked out and Docker Compose installed, you
can use our configuration to run both services:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker compose up --detach --wait dremio dremio-init flightsql-sqlite-test

.. _Dremio: https://www.dremio.com/
