===================
Quickstart (Python)
===================

Here we'll briefly tour basic features of ADBC with the SQLite driver.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install adbc_driver_manager adbc_driver_sqlite pyarrow

DBAPI (PEP 249)-style API
=========================

If PyArrow is installed, ADBC provides a high-level API in the style
of the DBAPI standard.

.. testcleanup:: dbapi

   cursor.close()
   conn.close()

Creating a Connection
---------------------

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> import adbc_driver_sqlite.dbapi
   >>> conn = adbc_driver_sqlite.dbapi.connect()

In application code, the connection must be closed after usage or
memory may leak.  Connections can be used as context managers to
accomplish this.

Creating a Cursor
-----------------

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> cursor = conn.cursor()

In application code, the cursor must be closed after usage or memory
may leak.  Cursors can be used as context managers to accomplish this.

Executing a Query
-----------------

We can execute a query and get the results via the normal,
row-oriented DBAPI interface:

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> cursor.execute("SELECT 1, 2.0, 'Hello, world!'")
   >>> cursor.fetchone()
   (1, 2.0, 'Hello, world!')
   >>> cursor.fetchone()

We can also get the results as Arrow data via a non-standard method:

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> cursor.execute("SELECT 1, 2.0, 'Hello, world!'")
   >>> cursor.fetch_arrow_table()
   pyarrow.Table
   1: int64
   2.0: double
   'Hello, world!': string
   ----
   1: [[1]]
   2.0: [[2]]
   'Hello, world!': [["Hello, world!"]]

Parameterized Queries
---------------------

We can bind parameters in our queries:

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> cursor.execute("SELECT ? + 1 AS the_answer", parameters=(41,))
   >>> cursor.fetch_arrow_table()
   pyarrow.Table
   the_answer: int64
   ----
   the_answer: [[42]]

Ingesting Bulk Data
-------------------

So far we've mostly demonstrated the usual DBAPI interface.  The ADBC
APIs also offer additional methods.  For example, we can insert a
table of Arrow data into a new database table:

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> import pyarrow
   >>> table = pyarrow.table([[1, 2], ["a", None]], names=["ints", "strs"])
   >>> cursor.adbc_ingest("sample", table)
   2
   >>> cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ints) FROM sample")
   >>> cursor.fetchall()
   [(2,)]

We can also append to an existing table:

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> table = pyarrow.table([[2, 3], [None, "c"]], names=["ints", "strs"])
   >>> cursor.adbc_ingest("sample", table, mode="append")
   2
   >>> cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ints) FROM sample")
   >>> cursor.fetchall()
   [(3,)]

Getting Database/Driver Metadata
--------------------------------

We can get information about the driver and the database using another
extension method, this time on the connection itself:

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> conn.adbc_get_info()["vendor_name"]
   'SQLite'
   >>> conn.adbc_get_info()["driver_name"]
   'ADBC SQLite Driver'

We can also query for tables and columns in the database.  This gives
a nested structure describing all the catalogs, schemas, tables, and
columns:

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> info = conn.adbc_get_objects().read_all().to_pylist()
   >>> main_catalog = info[0]
   >>> schema = main_catalog["catalog_db_schemas"][0]
   >>> tables = schema["db_schema_tables"]
   >>> tables[0]["table_name"]
   'sample'
   >>> [column["column_name"] for column in tables[0]["table_columns"]]
   ['ints', 'strs']

We can get the Arrow schema of a table:

.. doctest:: dbapi
   :skipif: adbc_driver_sqlite is None

   >>> conn.adbc_get_table_schema("sample")
   ints: int64
   strs: string
