   flight_sql

The ADBC project ships some drivers.  Others may (eventually) be
available from database vendors or third parties.  The drivers here
implement the Go API standard and are directly usable in Go.  They
also provide bindings that let them be used through the C API
standard, as well as Python bindings on top of that.
