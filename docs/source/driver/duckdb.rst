DuckDB Support
==============

**Available for:** C/C++, GLib/Ruby, Go, Python

`DuckDB`_ provides ADBC support since `version 0.8.0
<https://duckdb.org/2023/05/17/announcing-duckdb-080.html>`_.

.. note:: DuckDB is not part of the Apache Arrow project and is
          developed separately.

.. _DuckDB: https://duckdb.org/

Installation
============

See the `DuckDB documentation
<https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/>`_.

Usage
=====

ADBC support in DuckDB requires the driver manager.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: cpp

      See the `DuckDB C++ documentation`_.

   .. tab-item:: Go
      :sync: go

      You must have ``libduckdb.so`` on your ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, or
      in the same directory as the executable when you run this.  This
      requires CGO and loads the DuckDB driver.

      .. code-block:: go

         import (
            "context"

            "github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/go/adbc"
            "github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/go/adbc/drivermgr"
         )

         func main() {
            var drv drivermgr.Driver
            db, err := drv.NewDatabase(map[string]string{
               "driver": "libduckdb.so",
               "entrypoint": "duckdb_adbc_init",
            })
            if err != nil {
               // handle error
            }

            cnxn, err := db.Open(context.Background())
            if err != nil {
               // handle error
            }
            defer cnxn.Close()
         }

   .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: python

      You must have DuckDB 0.9.1 or higher.

      See the `DuckDB Python documentation`_.
