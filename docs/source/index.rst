         **Cross-language**, **Arrow-native** database access.

ADBC is a set of APIs and libraries for Arrow-native access to databases.
Execute SQL and Substrait_ queries, query database catalogs, and more, all
using Arrow data to eliminate unnecessary data copies, speed up access, and
make it more convenient to build analytical applications.

   .. grid-item-card:: Arrow-native
      :link: https://arrow.apache.org/

      Execute queries and get back results in Arrow format, eliminating extra
      data copies for Arrow-native backends.

   .. grid-item-card:: Backend-agnostic
      :link: driver/status
      :link-type: doc

      Connect to all kinds of databases, even ones that aren't Arrow-native.
      ADBC drivers optimize conversion to/from Arrow where required, saving
      work for developers.

      +++
      See Supported Drivers

   .. grid-item-card:: Cross-language

      Work in C/C++, C#, Go, Java, Python, R, Ruby, and more.

   .. grid-item-card:: Full-featured

      Execute SQL and Substrait, query database catalogs, inspect table
      schemas, and more.  ADBC handles common tasks without having to pull in
      another database client.

   .. grid-item-card:: Language-native

      Use language-native APIs that you're already familiar with, like DBAPI
      in Python, ``database/sql`` in Go, or DBI in R.
