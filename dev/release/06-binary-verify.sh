Subject: [VOTE] Release Apache Arrow ADBC ${RELEASE} - RC${rc_number}

Hello,

I would like to propose the following release candidate (RC${rc_number}) of Apache Arrow ADBC version ${version}. This is a release consisting of ${RESOLVED_ISSUES} resolved GitHub issues [1].

This release candidate is based on commit: ${commit} [2]

The source release rc${rc_number} is hosted at [3].
The binary artifacts are hosted at [4][5][6][7][8].
The changelog is located at [9].

Please download, verify checksums and signatures, run the unit tests, and vote on the release. See [10] for how to validate a release candidate.

See also a verification result on GitHub Actions [11].

The vote will be open for at least 72 hours.

[ ] +1 Release this as Apache Arrow ADBC ${version}
[ ] +0
[ ] -1 Do not release this as Apache Arrow ADBC ${version} because...

Note: to verify APT/YUM packages on macOS/AArch64, you must \`export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64\`. (Or skip this step by \`export TEST_APT=0 TEST_YUM=0\`.)
