## Building

### Environment Setup

Some dependencies are required to build and test the various ADBC packages.

For C/C++, you will most likely want a [Conda][conda] installation,
with [Mambaforge][mambaforge] being the most convenient distribution.
If you have Mambaforge installed, you can set up a development
environment as follows:

```shell
$ mamba create -n adbc --file ci/conda_env_cpp.txt
$ mamba activate adbc
```

(For other Conda distributions, you will likely need `create ... -c
conda-forge --file ...`).

There are additional environment definitions for development on Python
and GLib/Ruby packages.

Conda is not required; you may also use a package manager like Nix or
Homebrew, the system package manager, etc. so long as you configure
CMake or other build tool appropriately.  However, we primarily
develop and support Conda users.

[mambaforge]: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

### C/C++

All libraries here contained within one CMake project. To build any
library, pass the `-DADBC_COMPONENT=ON` flag to your cmake invocation,
replacing `_COMPONENT` with the name of the library/libraries.

_Note:_ unlike the Arrow C++ build system, the CMake projects will
**not** automatically download and build dependencies—you should
configure CMake appropriately to find dependencies in system or
package manager locations, if you are not using something like Conda.

You can use CMake presets to build and test:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../c --preset debug
# ctest reads presets from PWD
$ cd ../c
$ ctest --preset debug --test-dir ../build
```

You can also manually configure CMake.  For example, the driver manager and
postgres driver may be built together as follows:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ export CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
$ cmake ../c -DADBC_DRIVER_POSTGRESQL=ON -DADBC_DRIVER_MANAGER=ON
$ make -j
```

[`export CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`][cmake-compile-commands] is
not required, but is useful if you are using Visual Studio Code,
Emacs, or another editor that integrates with a C/C++ language server.

For information on what each library can do and their dependencies,
see their individual READMEs.

To specify where dependencies are to the build, use standard CMake
options such as [`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`][cmake-prefix-path].

Some build options are supported:

- `ADBC_BUILD_SHARED`, `ADBC_BUILD_STATIC`: toggle building the
  shared/static libraries.
- `ADBC_BUILD_TESTS`: build the unit tests (requires googletest/gmock).
- `ADBC_INSTALL_NAME_RPATH`: set `install_name` to `@rpath` on MacOS.
  Usually it is more convenient to explicitly set this to `OFF` for
  development.

All libraries use the same build options to enable tests.
For example, to build and run tests for the SQLite3 driver:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
# You may need to set -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH such that googletest can be found
$ cmake ../c -DADBC_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DADBC_DRIVER_SQLITE=ON
$ make -j
$ ctest
```

Tests use [Googletest][gtest].  Some libraries may have additional
test-time dependencies.  For instance, the PostgreSQL and Flight SQL
drivers require servers to test against.  See their individual READMEs
for details.

### Documentation

The documentation uses the [Sphinx][sphinx] documentation generator.

A list of dependencies for Conda (conda-forge) is included, and can be
used as follows:

```shell
$ conda create -n adbc -c conda-forge --file ci/conda_env_docs.txt
$ conda activate adbc
# Mermaid must be installed separately
# While "global", it will end up in your Conda environment
$ npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

To build the HTML documentation:

```shell
$ pushd c/apidoc
$ doxygen
$ popd

# Optionally: to also build the Python documentation
$ pushd python/adbc_driver_manager
$ pip install -e .[test]
$ popd

$ cd docs
$ make html
```

The output can be found in `build/`.

Some documentations are maintained as [Mermaid][mermaid] diagrams, which must
be rendered and checked in.  This can be done as follows:

```shell
cd docs
make -f mermaid.makefile -j all
# Check in the updated files
```

[mermaid]: https://mermaid.js.org/
[sphinx]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

### GLib

The GLib bindings use the [Meson][meson] build system.

A build of the [driver manager](./c/driver_manager/README.md) is
required.  For example, if the libraries are installed to
`$HOME/local`:

```shell
$ meson setup \
    --pkg-config-path=$HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig \
    --prefix=$HOME/local \
    build/glib \
    glib
$ meson install -C build/glib
```

A list of dependencies for Conda (conda-forge) is included, and can be
used as follows:

```shell
$ conda create -n adbc -c conda-forge --file ci/conda_env_glib.txt
$ conda activate adbc
```

### Go

Go libraries are a standard Go project.

```shell
$ cd go/adbc
$ go build -v ./...
$ go test -v ./...
```

### Java

The Java components are a standard Maven project.

```shell
$ cd java/
# Build and run tests
$ mvn clean install
```

### Python

Python libraries are managed with [setuptools][setuptools].  See
individual READMEs for additional dependencies.  In general, that
means all projects can be built as follows:

```shell
$ cd python/adbc_driver_manager
$ pip install -e .
```

Tests use [pytest][pytest].  Some libraries may have additional
test-time dependencies.  See their individual READMEs for details.

```shell
# Install dependencies
$ pip install -e .[test]

# Run tests
$ pytest -vvx
```

Type checking is done with [pyright][pyright].  There is a script to
run the type checker:

```shell
# Build native libraries first
$ env ADBC_USE_ASAN=0 ADBC_USE_UBSAN=0 ./ci/scripts/cpp_build.sh $(pwd) $(pwd)/build
# Install Python packages
$ ./ci/scripts/python_build.sh $(pwd) $(pwd)/build
# Run type checker
$ ./ci/scripts/python_typecheck.sh $(pwd)
```

[pyright]: https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/
[pytest]: https://docs.pytest.org/
[setuptools]: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html

### Ruby

The Ruby libraries are bindings around the GLib libraries.

### Rust

The Rust components are a standard Rust project.

```shell
$ cd rust
# Build and run tests
$ cargo test
```

## Opening a Pull Request

Before opening a pull request:

1. Please check if there is a corresponding issue (_and if not, please make one_).
2. Assign the issue to yourself by commenting "take" in the issue.
   (_Here's an [example](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/issues/1505#issuecomment-1920134722)._)
3. At the bottom of the PR description, add `Closes #NNNN` where `NNNN` is the
   issue number, so that the issue gets linked to your PR properly. ("Fixes"
   and other keywords that GitHub recognizes are also OK, of course.)

Before opening a pull request, please run the static checks, which are
enforced via [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/).  This will run
linters, formatters, and other analysis.  For example:

```shell
# Install pre-commit
$ pip install pre-commit
# or alternatively
$ conda install -c conda-forge --file ci/conda_env_dev.txt
# Set up hooks
$ pre-commit install
# Run manually
$ pre-commit run

$ git commit
```

When committing, please follow [Conventional
Commits][conventional-commits].  This helps maintain semantic
versioning of components.

Please use the following commit types: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`,
`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`.

Please use the following scopes:

- `c/driver/postgresql`, `java/driver-manager`, …: for a component and
  all its bindings.  For example, `c/driver-manager` covers the C/C++
  driver manager and its GLib and Python bindings, while
  `java/driver/flight-sql` covers only the Flight SQL driver for Java.
  (The scope names are derived from the filesystem paths.)
- `c/format`, `go/format`, `java/format`: for the core API definitions
  (adbc.h for C/C++, adbc.go for Go, adbc-core for Java).

For example:

```
feat(c/driver/postgresql): implement prepared statements

ci(go/adbc/drivermgr): pass through DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in tests

fix(java/driver/jdbc): adjust SQL type mapping for JDBC driver
```

## Re-generating 3rd Party Licenses

In order to collect the licenses for our Go-dependencies we leverage the
tool `github.com/google/go-licenses`. We have a template containing the
non-go licenses, and then you can install `go-licenses` with:

```shell
$ go install github.com/google/go-licenses@latest
```

You can generate the LICENSE.txt with the following command:

```shell
$ cd go/adbc && go-licenses report ./... \
  --ignore github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/go/adbc \
  --ignore github.com/apache/arrow/go/v11 \
  --ignore github.com/apache/arrow/go/v12 \
  --ignore github.com/apache/arrow/go/v13 \
  --ignore github.com/apache/arrow/go/v15 \
  --template ../../license.tpl > ../../LICENSE.txt 2> /dev/null
```

You will have to manually fix up the license, since some packages do not
fill out their metadata correctly and things like READMEs may end up in
the license.
