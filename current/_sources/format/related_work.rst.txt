Related Work
============

In the initial proposal, a survey of existing solutions and systems was
included, which is partially reproduced below for context, though note the
descriptions are only kept up-to-date on a best-effort basis.

Preexisting database client APIs
================================

:external:doc:`Arrow Flight SQL <format/FlightSql>`
  A standard building on top of Arrow Flight, defining how to use
  Flight to talk to databases, retrieve metadata, execute queries, and
  so on. Provides a single client in C++ and Java language that talks
  to any database servers implementing the protocol. Models its API
  surface (though not API design) after JDBC and ODBC.

`DBI for R <https://www.r-dbi.org/>`_
  An R package/ecosystem of packages for database access. Provides a
  single interface with "backends" for specific databases.  While
  row-oriented, `integration with Arrow is under consideration`_,
  including a sketch of effectively the same idea as ADBC.

`JDBC <https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=221>`_
  A Java library for database access, providing row-based
  APIs. Provides a single interface with drivers for specific
  databases.

`ODBC <https://github.com/microsoft/ODBC-Specification>`_
  A language-agnostic standard from the ISO/IEC for database access,
  associated with Microsoft. Feature-wise, it is similar to JDBC (and
  indeed JDBC can wrap ODBC drivers), but it offers columnar data
  support through fetching buffers of column values (with some
  caveats). Provides a single C interface with drivers for specific
  databases.

`PEP 249 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_ (DBAPI 2.0)
  A Python standard for database access providing row-based APIs. Not
  a singular package, but rather a set of interfaces that packages
  implement.

Preexisting libraries
=====================

These are libraries which either 1) implement columnar data access for
a particular system; or 2) could be used to implement such access.

:external:doc:`Arrow Flight <format/Flight>`
  An RPC framework optimized for transferring Arrow record batches,
  with application-specific extension points but without any higher
  level semantics.

:external+arrow:doc:`Arrow JDBC <java/jdbc>`
  A Java submodule, part of Arrow/Java, that uses the JDBC API to
  produce Arrow data. Internally, it can read data only row-at-a-time.

`arrow-odbc <https://github.com/pacman82/arrow-odbc>`_
  A Rust community project that uses the ODBC API to produce Arrow
  data, using ODBC’s buffer-based API to perform bulk copies. (See
  also: Turbodbc.)

`Arrowdantic <https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/arrowdantic/>`_
  Python bindings for an implementation of ODBC<>Arrow in Rust.

`pgeon <https://github.com/0x0L/pgeon>`_
  A client that manually parses the Postgres wire format and produces
  Arrow data, bypassing JDBC/ODBC. While it attempts to optimize this
  case, the Postgres wire protocol is still row-oriented.

`Turbodbc <https://turbodbc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
  A set of Python ODBC bindings, implementing PEP 249, that also
  provides APIs to fetch data as Arrow batches, optimizing the
  conversion internally.
