/// \brief Common entry point for drivers via the driver manager.
///
/// The driver manager can fill in default implementations of some
/// ADBC functions for drivers. Drivers must implement a minimum level
/// of functionality for this to be possible, however, and some
/// functions must be implemented by the driver.
///
/// \param[in] driver_name An identifier for the driver (e.g. a path to a
///   shared library on Linux).
/// \param[in] entrypoint An identifier for the entrypoint (e.g. the
///   symbol to call for AdbcDriverInitFunc on Linux).
/// \param[in] count The number of entries to initialize. Provides
///   backwards compatibility if the struct definition is changed.
/// \param[out] driver The table of function pointers to initialize.
/// \param[out] initialized How much of the table was actually
///   initialized (can be less than count).
/// \param[out] error An optional location to return an error message
///   if necessary.
