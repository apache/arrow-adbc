/// to be possible, however, and some functions must be implemented by the driver.
///
/// This function is different from AdbcLoadDriver in that it also accepts the name
/// of a driver manifest file, and allows specifying options to control what
/// directories it will search through. The behavior is as follows:
///
/// If the passed in driver_name is an absolute path:
/// - If the path has a `.toml` extension, it will attempt to parse the manifest and load
///   the driver specified within it. Erroring if this fails.
/// - If the path has an extension other than `.toml`, it will attempt to load the path as
///   a shared library. Erroring if this fails.
///
/// If the passed in driver_name does not have an extension and is not an absolute path:
/// - The load_options parameter will control whether the driver manager will search the
///   environment variable ADBC_DRIVER_PATH and (if built or installed with conda) the
///   conda environment, the user-level configuration, and/or the system-level
///   configuration for either a manifest file or a shared library.
/// - For each path to be searched, it will first look for <path>/<driver_name>.toml. If
///   that file exists, it will attempt to parse the manifest and load the driver
///   specified within it, erroring if this fails.
/// - If the manifest file does not exist, it will then look for
/// <path>/<driver_name>.<extension>
///   where <extension> is one of the following: `.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`. If it can load
///   that shared library, then success is returned. Otherwise it moves to the next
///   directory until the search is either successful, or all directories have been
///   searched.
