//! Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC) allows efficient connections to databases
//! for OLAP workloads:
//!
//!  * Uses the Arrow [C Data interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html)
//!    and [C Stream Interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CStreamInterface.html)
//!    for efficient data interchange.
//!  * Supports partitioned result sets for multi-threaded or distributed
//!    applications.
//!  * Support for [Substrait](https://substrait.io/) plans in addition to SQL queries.
//!
//! When implemented for remote databases, [Flight SQL](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html)
//! can be used as the communication protocol. This means data can be in Arrow
//! format through the whole connection, minimizing serialization and deserialization
//! overhead.
//!
//! Read more about ADBC at <https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/>
//!
//! There are two flavors of ADBC that this library supports:
//!
//!  * **Native Rust implementations**. These implement the traits at the top level of
//!    this crate, starting with [AdbcDatabase].
//!  * **C API ADBC drivers**. These can be implemented in any language (that compiles
//!    to native code) and can be used by any language.
//!
//! # Native Rust drivers
//!
//! Native Rust drivers will implement the traits:
//!
//!  * [AdbcDatabase]
//!  * [AdbcConnection]
//!  * [AdbcStatement]
//!
//! For drivers implemented in Rust, using these will be more efficient and safe,
//! since it avoids the overhead of going through C FFI.
//!
//! # Using C API drivers
