# Snowflake driver for Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC)

A [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com) [ADBC](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/)
driver, based on the
[ADBC Snowflake Go driver](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/tree/main/go/adbc/driver/snowflake).

## Example

```rust
# #![doc(test(attr(test_with::env(ADBC_SNOWFLAKE_TESTS))))]
use adbc_core::{Connection, Statement};
use adbc_snowflake::{connection, database, Driver};
use arrow_array::{cast::AsArray, types::Decimal128Type};

# #[cfg(feature = "env")]
# fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

// Load the driver
let mut driver = Driver::try_load()?;

// Construct a database using environment variables
let mut database = database::Builder::from_env().build(&mut driver)?;

// Create a connection to the database
let mut connection = connection::Builder::from_env().build(&mut database)?;

// Construct a statement to execute a query
let mut statement = connection.new_statement()?;

// Execute a query
statement.set_sql_query("SELECT 21 + 21")?;
let mut reader = statement.execute()?;

// Check the result
let batch = reader.next().expect("a record batch")?;
assert_eq!(
    batch.column(0).as_primitive::<Decimal128Type>().value(0),
    42
);

# Ok(()) }
# #[cfg(not(feature = "env"))]
# fn main() {}
```

## Crate features

### Linking Go driver

This crate is a wrapper around the Go driver.

There are different methods to load the Go driver:

#### `bundled` (default)

Builds the driver from source and links it statically. This requires a Go
compiler to be available at build time. This is the default behavior.

#### `linked`

Link the driver at build time. This requires the driver library to be available
both at build- and runtime. Set `ADBC_SNOWFLAKE_GO_LIB_DIR` during the build to
add search paths for the linker.

#### Runtime only

It's also possible to build this crate without the driver and only link at
runtime. This requires disabling the `bundled` and `linked` features. Linking
at runtime is also available when the other features are enabled.

### Configuration

The crate provides builders that can be initialized from environment variables.

#### `env` (default)

Adds `from_env` methods to initialize builders from environment variables.

#### `dotenv`: `env` (default)

Loads environment variables from `.env` files in `from_env` methods.
